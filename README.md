# Sparse Tensor Classifier Step-by-Step Tutorial

In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to use Sparse Tensor Classifier (STC), a supervised classification algorithm for categorical supporting multiclass and multilabel classification, online learning, prior knowledge, automatic dataset balancing, missing data, and providing a native explanation of its predictions both for single instances and for each target class label globally. 

The algorithm is implemented in SQL and made available via the Python module `stc` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/stc/). By default, the library uses an in-memory SQLite database, shipped with Python standard library, that require no configuration by the user. However, it is possible to configure STC to run on alternative DBMS in order to take advantage of persistent storage and scalability.
